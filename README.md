# LAHD: Louisiana Hospital Directory
                                        Group Project for the LSU's CSC 3380 course. 

In this course we learned about OO design principles and utilizing UML for software archtitecture. LAHD is a web application created to provide Louisiana citizens with a one-stop resource to find information on acute-care facilities near them and read reviews left by other patients. We saw a need for an application such as this after seeing the impact of Covid-19. Even after curfew and mask mandates were lifted, there was still an influx of Covid-19 patients in acute-care facilities; which made it harder for hospitals to take on other patients as there was a limited number of beds. LAHD provides information on the number of staffed beds, total discharges, total patient days, tps quality score, and patient reviews for each acute-care facility. This makes it easier on patients who don't have Covid-19 to find an acute-care faciity that will best suit their needs.
